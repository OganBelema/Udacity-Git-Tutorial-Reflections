How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It showed me where the changes in the file made
What was added and what was removed

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Having version control will make it easier to revert to previous implementations and track bugs.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: It gives better control of the when commit is made and prevents commiting code that is not finished
Cons: If there is an unexpected shutdown, changes will be lost

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
In the case of projects while files might require each other to execute a task.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
You use git log to get a list of commits and then use git diff with two commit ids to see the difference between the commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Thanks to version control you added test out expiremental features knowing that you can always revert to your stable version that has been committed.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Manage versions of my android projects.
